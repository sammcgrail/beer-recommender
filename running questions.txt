Running Questions

1) CSV file will be imported into database. Some of the columns are fractions like '5/10' or '7/20' (without single quotes). I'll be using these numbers to make averages and use them in the calculation for recommendations. How best to treat these in the db table? As a string (and then convert to float? or import)

2) How do I get the CSV into activerecord to create a seeds file?

3) Will setting the primary key with (self.primary_key = 'beer_id' or self.primary_key = 'brewer_id') cause problems?
